Unless you're here for something really small and generally useless,
with a very liberal Open Source license, you really want something
useful.  Like

  * [wget](https://www.gnu.org/software/wget/), or
  * [curl](https://curl.haxx.se/)

The uget project is the development arena for the `ssdp-scan` tool in
the [ssdp-responder](https://github.com/troglobit/ssdp-responder/)
project.  You may also find an equally stupid web server here.  Please
don't use it for anything remotely production oriented!

Take care
